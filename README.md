# Reonic Simulation Test

This project is a frontend application designed to simulate the charging of electric cars in a shop parking lot. Users can input various parameters to observe how different configurations affect the charging process.

## Features

- **Simulation Parameters**: Configure the number of charging points, arrival probability of cars, car consumption (in kWh), and charging power per charging point (in kW).
- **Dynamic Data Generation**: Simulate charging events based on user inputs.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes using Tailwind CSS.
- **Translation**: Supporting English ü´ñ, German ü•® and Italian üçï languages.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/matteobu/reonic.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd reonic
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   Ensure you have [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed. Then, run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Create the mocked data**:

   ```bash
   cd src/mocks
   node generateData.mjs
   ```

   The application should now have the mocked data in the folder `src/mocks`.

5. **Start the development server**:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The application should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1. **Configure Simulation Parameters**: Adjust the input fields to set the number of charging points, arrival probability, car consumption, and charging power.
2. **View Results**: Analyze the output, including total energy charged, number of charging events, and heatmaps of consumed energy.

## Assumptions

- Each car requires a charging duration proportional to its consumption and the charging power of the station.
